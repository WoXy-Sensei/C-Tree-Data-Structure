## About

This project is a simple tree data structure implemented in C++. The tree structure is used to store and manage data in a hierarchical manner through nodes and connections. This repository serves as a good resource to understand and utilize the tree data structure as part of your C++ projects.

## Tree Data Structure

This C++ tree data structure supports fundamental tree operations:

- Adding nodes to the tree
- Removing nodes from the tree
- Traversing the tree level by level (preorder, inorder, postorder)

## How to Use

Follow these steps to utilize this tree data structure in your C++ projects:

1. Clone or download the project files to your computer.
2. Add the Tree.h and Tree.cpp files to your C++ project.
3. Perform tree operations such as adding, removing nodes, and traversing the tree.

## Example Usage

Below is a simple example of using this tree data structure:

```cpp
#include "iostream"
#include "../include/Tree.h"
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    Tree *treeList = new Tree();
    treeList->append(30);
    treeList->append(15);
    treeList->append(45);
    treeList->append(25);
    treeList->append(40);
    treeList->append(60);


    treeList->preOrder();
    cout << endl;
    treeList->postOrder();
    cout << endl;
    treeList->inOrder();
    cout << endl;
    treeList->remove(25);

    treeList->preOrder();
    
}
```
